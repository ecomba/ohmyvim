OH MY VIM! :)

My personal Vim setup. Using GitHub to sync between home/work/netbook. Feel free to use and/or fork your own.

Included plugins:
* rails.vim
* snippets.vim
* rspec.vim
* cucumber.vim
* git.vim
* tComment.vim
* FuzzyFinder and FuzzyFinder Textmate (needs Ruby)
* NERD Tree

Works best if you don't already have any Vim setup.

git clone git://github.com/sermoa/ohmyvim.git ~/.vim

Set the .vimrc file as a symlink to get updates.

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

Periodically, to keep up to date:

cd ~/.vim
git pull
